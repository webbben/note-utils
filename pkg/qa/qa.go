Meeting Notes 1/20/2025

Today we met with the infrastructure team to talk about deploying the Web UI project. However, they said that due to shifting priorities,
the deployment would be delayed until next week. They asked me to prepare information for Circle-CI though, so I will be filling out the details.
They would like this done by next Tuesday. I guess this time we won't be using Vercel?

Question from user:

What were the names of the people we met with?

Output:

I couldn't find this information in the source material. It seems the notes just say there was a meeting with "the infrastructure team".

Question from user:

What method of deployment are we using?

Output:

It seems that Circle-CI will be used for deployment, as the notes say the writer is asked to "prepare information for Circle-CI".
The writer also seems to be a bit surprised that this time they "won't be using Vercel", which suggests that usually Vercel is being used for deployment, but not this time.

Question from user:

When is deployment going to happen?

Output:

The note, written in 1/20/2025, suggests that due to "shifting priorities", the infrastructure says deployment would be "delayed until next week".
However, it's not clear exactly what day of the week the deployment was planned for.
