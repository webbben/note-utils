# Meeting Notes 2/6/2025

Met with the cybersecurity team again about the data breach issue again. For some reason they are really upset about it. I can't really understand why, I mean
this time it was only 1.2k accounts! Much better than the 20k from last time... sheesh.

Anyway, they made the following requests:

- next week have another meeting on tuesday to review vulnerabilities again
- reach out to backend team to review why our server is giving out admin passwords when you query it's IP without auth tokens
- implement a code review and testing process, to hopefully mitigate futre issues.

Man these guys are a pain in the ass!
