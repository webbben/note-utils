I talked to Alex on the phone today about the Visa application process, and he had a lot to say. Apparently, you should NOT apply by mail.
The applications apparently go missing sometimes if you do... He also said that they requested a sample of his underwear, for some kind of identification process.
Weird if you ask me. Anyway, he's going to be flying in next week, so we will have to get everything wrapped up by then.

Follow-ups for next time: check visa status, call the immigration bureau about the underwear inspection status, and expedite shipping for his visa to arrive by next Thursday.
