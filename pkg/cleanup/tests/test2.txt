Today I had a design meeting with Frank for the backend authentication system. 
He had some feedback he wanted to give, including that we should avoid 3rd party packages if possible, and also that the current proposal
might have some performance issues based on how we integrate with other services. He also added that an ERD would be nice.

We are planning to meet again next week, so I'll try to address some of these concerns for next time.
